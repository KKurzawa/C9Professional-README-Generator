# C9 README Generator

## Description

This project is a command line application that generates a high-quality README file quickly.  A README file is important for any Github repository.  This project will allow the user to spend more time focusing on the project and less on the README.  This project was my first command line application, my first use of Node.js, as well as my first experience with back-end development.
