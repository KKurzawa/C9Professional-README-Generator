# C9 README Generator

## Description

This project is a command line application that generates a high-quality README file quickly.  A README file is important for any Github repository.  This project will allow the user to spend more time focusing on the project and less on the README.  This project was my first command line application, my first use of Node.js, as well as my first experience with back-end development.


## Usage

Enter 'Node index.js' in the appropriate folder of your command line.  Awnswer all the questions prompted and you will recieve a well polished README.md file.  This README file will contain a clickable table of contents that will take you to the correct topic, a clicklable licensce badge that will show you the requirements of the license, links to collaborators/attribitions, and all the neccesities of a proper README.md file.
